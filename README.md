# DD-WRT-4G-LTE

To convert an old WiFi router and phone into a high-performance LTE router in 2024, here's a step-by-step guide leveraging the stability and extended functionality provided by DD-WRT firmware.

## Backgroud

We know consumer WiFi routers are piece of crap because of the poor firmware that is never updated after the first factory release. They sometimes requires reboot more or less often. It is well know that replacing the original firmware with DD-WRT (if supported) the music change. Your router can be transformed in a rock solid router that you will never reboot. 

Ready to convert a 10 year old router (TP-Link Archer C9) and a 7 year old phone (iPhone 8) into the best ever consumer LTE router in 2024.

## Materials Needed

- **Old Router** (preferably compatible with DD-WRT)
- **Old Smartphone** with LTE capability
- **USB Charging Cable**

## Step 1: Install DD-WRT on the Router

- **Identify Router Compatibility:**

  Check if your old router is compatible with DD-WRT firmware by visiting the DD-WRT database here.

- **Download DD-WRT Firmware:**

  Download the appropriate DD-WRT firmware for your router model from the database.

- **Flash the Router:**

  Follow the router-specific instructions to flash DD-WRT onto your router. This usually involves:
    Logging into the routerâ€™s web interface.
    Uploading the DD-WRT firmware.
    Waiting for the installation to complete.

## Step 2: Set Up the Smartphone as a Hotspot

  - **Enable Hotspot:**

    On your old smartphone, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Hotspot & Tethering.
    Enable Mobile Hotspot and configure the SSID (network name) and password.

  - **Connect the Smartphone to the Router:**

    Use a USB cable to connect the smartphone to the router. Some routers with DD-WRT support USB tethering directly. If not, you can still use the phone as a wireless hotspot.
